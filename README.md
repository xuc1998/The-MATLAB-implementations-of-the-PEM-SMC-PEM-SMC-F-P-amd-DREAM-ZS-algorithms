Case Study 1: a two-dimensional probability distribution with 20 modes
Case Study 2: estimating Common Land Model (CoLM) parameters using synthetic observations
Case Study 3: estimating CoLM parameters using observed datasets

The target.m in each directory corresponds to the computation of the likelihood function.

The codes for the three algorithms are all implemented in MATLAB. 

Considering the Linux environment requirement of the CoLM model, all three case studies were executed on the 
Supercomputing Center of Lanzhou University.
